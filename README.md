This project implements a real-time drone surveillance system using a custom-trained YOLOv5 model for object detection. It detects drones (and potentially other targets like vehicles or personnel) in video streams, draws bounding boxes with confidence scores, and issues warnings when targets enter a user-defined restricted area. The system is designed for defense applications, with a custom model (multi_modal_drone_vision.pt) trained to support multi-modal data (RGB and thermal), enhancing robustness in diverse conditions (day/night, adverse weather).

This project demonstrates advanced computer vision techniques, including real-time object detection and user interaction, tailored for combat and surveillance drones. It serves as a prototype for autonomous defense systems, aligning with the goal of building Indiaâ€™s indigenous combat drone technology.
